# Instructions

## Init repo

```
git clone https://github.com/claes-magnus/LOCUS-X.git
```

```
git pull
```

## Upload new sounds to folder sounds/


### Option 1)

```
git pull
git add sound.mp3
git commit -m "Made some changes..."
git push
```
* First time: you may need to push to remote (the console will tell what you to do)

### Option 2)

### Problems

* No worries! Git is a version control system; nothing is lost!


# Smile and do, make, say, think! :)
